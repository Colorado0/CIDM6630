This restaurant application takes the form of an online restaurant queue that would take names via the web and allow restaurant staff to seat folks based on the date_added field.  Under routes.py there is class called signupForm that posts a "name" field to capture a string that allows customers to enter their name up to 64 characters long.   The app will then get that customers entry and load it into the database named restaurant.db.  
The models.py module creates a class Customer for the database that contains an auto-generated ID, name string, and date_added attribute.  The REPR will return the customer's name and date_added to the staff of the restaurant.
run.py allows us to open a browser session to interact with the external world via http.
